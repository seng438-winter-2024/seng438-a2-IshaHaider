# 1 Introduction

This assignment is structured to provide students with a thorough exploration of automated unit testing in Java using the JUnit framework, with a breakdown into three key sections: 

- familiarization with the testing environment. 
- development of unit tests code based on Javadocs. 
- execution of test suites on multiple versions of the System Under Test.

In the familiarization stage, participants are required to grasp the foundational concepts of setting up the software system under test (SUT) using Eclipse, configuring necessary Java libraries, and creating a basic JUnit test suite for subsequent testing activities. In the unit test development phase, participants are tasked with creating comprehensive test cases for two specific classes, org.jfree.data.Range and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities. The focus includes understanding API specifications, employing mocking objects for testing methods, creating a test plan, applying black-box test-case design techniques, and ultimately coding JUnit and JMock test methods based on the devised test-case design. The final phase involves executing test suites on various versions of the System Under Test (SUT), identifying discrepancies in system behavior as part of the ongoing testing process.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

# Test Objective
The test objectives are to verify the functionality of various methods within the classes of org.jfree.data package: org.jfree.data.Range and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities. The unit testing should primarily focus on black-box testing to cover the input space as only the requirements of the methods have been provided, suggesting a criteria-based testing approach.

# Testing Strategy and Test-case Design

In the org.jfree.data.Range and org.jfree.data.utilities classes, there is one type of testing primarily conducted.
Black-box testing: Since only the requirements of each method are given, strategies such as equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are used 
To begin testing methods, the steps to complete each strategy of black-box testing must first be outlined in order to create streamlined tests for scalable debugging. The following steps are to be used as reference guides in test-case design and determining the scope of the functions/inputs/outputs to be covered.

# Equivalence Classes/Partitioning:
Equivalence Partitioning is a systematic technique used in black-box testing to divide the input domain into equivalence classes. Here are the steps to follow when applying Equivalence Partitioning in tests for the org.jfree.data.Range and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities:

1. Understand the Requirements: Carefully review the requirements or specifications for the software component under test. Identify the input variables and their expected behavior based on these requirements.

2. Identify Input Variables: Determine the input variables or parameters of the method or component being tested. These are the values that the software will accept and process.

3. Derive Input Domains: For each input variable, determine the range of valid and invalid values. This forms the input domain, which includes all possible values that the input variable can take.

4. Divide into Equivalence Classes: Divide the input domain into equivalence classes. An equivalence class is a subset of the input domain where all the values in that subset are considered equivalent in terms of the system's behavior.

5. Identify Boundary Values: For each equivalence class, identify the boundary values. These are the values at the edges of each equivalence class, where the behavior of the system might change.

6. Select Representative Values: Choose one or more representative values from each equivalence class, including boundary values, to design test cases. These values will be used as inputs for testing.

7. Design Test Cases: Create test cases that cover each equivalence class and include both valid and invalid inputs. Each test case should represent a different equivalence class and should exercise the behavior specified in the requirements.

8. Execute Test Cases: Execute the designed test cases against the software component under test. Observe the behavior of the system and compare the actual results with the expected results.

9. Analyze Results: Analyze the test results to determine if the software behaves as expected for each equivalence class. Identify any discrepancies or failures and investigate the root causes.

10. Iterate if Necessary: If any defects are found or if test coverage is insufficient, refine the test cases or identify additional equivalence classes and repeat the testing process as needed.

Following these steps ensures thorough testing of the software component while efficiently covering the input space and verifying compliance with the requirements.


# Boundary Value Analysis:
Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a testing technique used in black-box testing to identify test cases at the boundaries of input domains. Here are the steps to follow when applying Boundary Value Analysis in tests for the org.jfree.data.Range and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities:

1. Understand the Requirements: Carefully review the requirements or specifications for the software component under test. Identify the input variables and their expected behavior based on these requirements.

2. Identify Input Variables: Determine the input variables or parameters of the method or component being tested. These are the values that the software will accept and process.

3. Derive Input Domains: For each input variable, determine the range of valid and invalid values. This forms the input domain, which includes all possible values that the input variable can take.

4. Identify Boundary Values: For each input variable, identify the boundary values. These are the values at the edges of the input domain where the behavior of the system might change. Boundary values include the minimum, maximum, and values just inside and outside the valid range.

5. Determine Test Cases: Generate test cases based on the identified boundary values. Each test case should cover one or more boundary values for each input variable. Consider both the valid and invalid boundaries.

6. Consider Equivalence Classes: While BVA focuses on testing boundary values, it's important to also include test cases for the equivalence classes within the valid and invalid ranges. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the input domain.

7. Design Test Cases: Create test cases based on the identified boundary values and equivalence classes. Ensure that each test case represents a specific boundary condition and exercises the behavior specified in the requirements.

8. Execute Test Cases: Execute the designed test cases against the software component under test. Observe the behavior of the system and compare the actual results with the expected results.

9. Analyze Results: Analyze the test results to determine if the software behaves as expected at the boundaries of the input domain. Identify any discrepancies or failures and investigate the root causes.

10. Iterate if Necessary: If any defects are found or if test coverage is insufficient, refine the test cases or identify additional boundary values and repeat the testing process as needed.

Following these steps ensures thorough testing of the software component while focusing on critical boundary conditions that are more likely to lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

#Benefits and Drawbacks of Mocking

For methods utilizing interfaces, mocking is required as the specified unit of code depends upon an external object. Essentially, these mock objects mimic the real object being replaced, but do not actually perform any real functions. Testers can specifically set values, errors, etc. to simulate the behavior of an object in a controlled environment, without having to worry about other dependencies. This dummy implementation for an interface or class is made in a Mock framework, namely jMock for the purposes of this test suite. A mock object is created to return a descriptor that can be used to call methods on. 

@Test
public void test_calculateColumnTotalEmptyDataTable() {
    // setup
    Mockery mockingContext = new Mockery();
    final Values2D values = mockingContext.mock(Values2D.class);
    mockingContext.checking(new Expectations() {
        {
            one(values).getRowCount();
            will(returnValue(0)); // Zero rows
        }
    });
    // exercise
    double result = DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(values, 0);
    // verify
    assertEquals(result, 0.0, .000000001d); // Expected sum: 0 (empty data table)

As the method calculateColumnTotal requires a Values2D parameter, it is an indication that the code depends on an external object. In the above example, mocking is used to create a Values2D object and set data for it by calling methods such as getRow() and specifying what it will return (lines 8-9). 

The drawbacks of mocking mostly revolve around excessive and careless use. Over-mocking and under-testing are a major concern that our group faced in that mocking could unknowingly become a workaround for bad code design. In over utilizing the benefits of mocking, testing the actual interaction of the method with fully-functional objects can be overlooked, resulting in a lack of coverage.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Members of the group each read through the introduction and completed exercises 2.1.1-2.1.4 independently. The development of unit test code (2.2) was split amongst three members, 1 person on design and two on writing the test code based on the design. Once the design component was complete, the other two members were briefed on the approach to testing and what kind of constraints existed in development. They reviewed the test plan and determined the testing strategy, the methods to be tested, and their respective details (parameters, return).

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

A difficulty faced was setting up the testing environment in Eclipse for one of our team members. Initially we came up with a system where she would use our computer resources for her part of the project. To fully overcome this challenge however we restarted the entire set up on her end multiple times and downloaded various files until she was able to complete the lab with her own laptop.
